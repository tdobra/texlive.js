texlive.js 
==========

This is a port of TeX Live 2016 to Javascript. 
It creates PDF files from LaTeX code and supports packages.

manuels ported TeX Live 2010, and fzimmermann89 ported TeX Live 2016 (basic distribution) with Bibtex. This project adds the TeX Gyre Heros font and the packages xcolor, tikz, anyfontsize, forloop, everyshi and rotating. The user interface webpage is based on that of manuels and was created to demonstrate uploading arbitrary files into the file system.
